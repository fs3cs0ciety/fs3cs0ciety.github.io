### Throw it in binja and lets get this party started

* `sub_1209()` is inside of an if statement with a pointer set to a a buffer as an arg and then the results of that function are compared to `0`. It's checking our `"license key"`, lets find out!

### `sub_1209()` :

* Binja is so nice isnt it! We see damn near the entire flag at the top of that function but if we look at the disassembly instead of the `HLIL` we see that these values are all hardcoded in and we can turn those into decimal and then use the `xxd` command. We happen to be missing a section of the flag lets inspect further into the disassembly.
* We need to set a bp at `sub_1209` so that would be `0x00001209` and run the program.
* `if (strlen(arg1) != 0x24)` our input is going to be 36 chars.
* Inside of the while loop we see our input is being compared to a string stored in memory. Hmmm...
* We need to break on this `cmp` which is `0x0000555555555419` since the binary is now up and running.

### Finding the flag

* If we click on the address being stored inside of the `rbp` register we are brought right to the flag and we see it is unmasked in memory, hence the reason for setting the bp on the `cmp` to `0x24` inside of the if statement.
