* Immediatly looking into `main()`, we see a comparison happening

```nasm
000014d0        if (var_48 != 0x86187)
0000158a            puts(str: "Sorry, that's not it!")
```

* Nice, so if `var_48` is not qual to `0x86187` call `puts()`. Instresting ...
* `0x86187` is `549255` in decimal, its the programs favorite number!!!

### Just incase you didnt know we can do this
