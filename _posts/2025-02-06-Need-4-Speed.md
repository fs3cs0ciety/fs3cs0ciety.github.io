* Not gonna lie guys, this one was to easy... `set_timer()` is most likely causing the `Not fast enough. BOOM!` message to display and exit just by seeing the way the functions are set up.

* I filled `mov eax, 0x0` with nop instructions as well as the `call set_timer`. Its like the function was never even there 😂.
